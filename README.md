# Fog::AzureRM

Module for the 'fog' gem to support Windows Azure Resource Manager

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fog-azurerm'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fog-azurerm
    
    
## Usage

You can use this gem against the Microsoft Azure Resource Manager Services in the cloud. Of course, to use the Microsoft Azure Resource Manager Services in the cloud, you need to first [create a Microsoft Azure account](http://www.azure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/).


### Setup Connection

The next step to use this gem, is authentication and permissioning. For people unfamilar with Azure this may be one of
the more difficult concepts. For a reference on setting up a service principal from the command line see
[Authenticating a service principal with Azure Resource Manager](http://aka.ms/cli-service-principal) or
[Unattended Authentication](http://aka.ms/auth-unattended). For a more robust explanation of authentication in Azure,
see [Developerâ€™s guide to auth with Azure Resource Manager API](http://aka.ms/arm-auth-dev-guide).

After creating the service principal, you should have three pieces of information, a client id (GUID), client secret
(string) and tenant id (GUID).
