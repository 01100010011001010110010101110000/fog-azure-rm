# Fog Azure Resource Manager

This document describes how to get started with Fog using Microsoft Azure as a cloud resource management services provider.

## Pre-requisites

* Fog-azure-rm supports Ruby version 2.0.0 or later

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fog-azure-rm'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fog-azure-rm
    
    
## Usage

You can use this gem against the Microsoft Azure Resource Manager Services in the cloud. Of course, to use the Microsoft Azure Resource Manager Services in the cloud, you need to first [create a Microsoft Azure account](http://www.azure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/).


### Authentication

The next step to use this gem, is authentication and permissioning. It is important to get familiar with this concept. For a reference on setting up a service principal from the command line see
[Authenticating a service principal with Azure Resource Manager](http://aka.ms/cli-service-principal) or
[Unattended Authentication](http://aka.ms/auth-unattended). For a more robust explanation of authentication in Azure,
see [Developerâ€™s guide to auth with Azure Resource Manager API](http://aka.ms/arm-auth-dev-guide).

After creating the service principal, you should have three pieces of information, a client id (GUID), client secret
(string) and tenant id (GUID).
